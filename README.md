# Project Description

This project is an example of data analysis and visualization using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. The project is executed in Google Colab, which makes it easy to run and edit the code in a cloud environment.


# Main stages of the project
### Data Download: 
The pandas library is used to download and pre-process data.

### Data analysis: 
Data analysis is performed, including the calculation of statistics, processing of missing values and filtering.

### Visualization: 
Graphs are built using matplotlib, seaborn and plotly to visually represent the data.

### Interactive elements: 
Interactive graphs have been added using plotly for deeper analysis.

# Technologies used
### Python: 
The main programming language.

### pandas: 
For working with data.

### matplotlib and seaborn: 
For static visualization.

### plotly: 
For interactive visualization.

### Google Colab: 
A cloud environment for code execution.

# How to use
Follow the link to the project in Google Colab.

Run the code cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualization.

You can change the code and data to perform your own analysis.

# Examples of visualizations
Histograms of the data distribution.

Linear graphs of time changes.

Interactive scattering diagrams.
